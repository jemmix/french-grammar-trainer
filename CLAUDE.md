# French Grammar Trainer — Project Guidelines

## Language Policy
- **App interface & grammar content**: Everything in French (UI text, questions, explanations, section titles)
- **Code, comments, commit messages, docs (PLAN.md, README, etc.)**: English
- **TABLE_OF_CONTENTS.md and other course material files**: French (course material, not app docs)

## Workflow
- **Course material / ToC changes**: Commit and push without asking — these are safe to land unattended
- **Code changes**: Always get user review before committing
- **CLAUDE.md**: Update liberally to reflect user preferences and vibes as they emerge
