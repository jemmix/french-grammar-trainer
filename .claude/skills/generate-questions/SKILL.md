## File Header

Start the file with:
```

```

## MCQ Format (questions 001–020)

```

Default to 4 choices (1 right + 3 wrong). Use 3 when more feel forced; 5 for "which sentence is correct" questions.

MCQ wrong answer diversity per question:
- ~1–2 on-topic (same grammar family, different form — e.g. wrong person, wrong tense ending)
- ~1 adjacent topic (e.g. imparfait instead of passé composé)
- ~1 left-field plausible (different construct a learner might confuse)

## INPUT Format (questions 021–025)

```

ID: <rule-id>-<NNN>

INPUT questions have **5–10 wrong answers**. Aim for 5; add more (up to 10) when there are additional common learner mistakes worth capturing. Never go below 5.

INPUT wrong answers should cover the most likely learner errors: wrong person/number, wrong tense (imparfait, futur, conditionnel), wrong auxiliary, wrong participle form, wrong agreement.

**PROMPT field**: write only the brief instruction — do NOT include "Instruction :" as a prefix. Example: `Conjuguez le verbe en -ir au présent de l'indicatif`.

## General Content Rules

- All prompts, answers, and explanations must be in **French**
- Wrong answers must be plausible learner mistakes — not random noise
- Vary subjects (je, tu, il, elle, nous, vous, ils, elles) across questions
- Vary verbs and contexts — do not repeat the same verb more than 3–4 times across the file
- RIGHT ANSWER should use proper capitalisation (matching is case-insensitive but the UI shows a case warning)

## ARGUMENTS

The user passes: `<rule-id> <rule title> <output-filename>`

For example: `02-01 "Formation du passé composé avec avoir" 02-01.txt`

Generate all 25 questions covering the grammar rule thoroughly, then write the complete file.
